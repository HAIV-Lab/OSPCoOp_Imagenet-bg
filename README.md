## News

[03/2025]🎉  We have released the proposed [ImageNet-Bg](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiangexiang/imagenet-bg-ospcoop-cvpr2025).

[02/2025]🎉  Our paper has been accepted by CVPR2025.

## The proposed ImageNet-Bg

To further test the robustness of the model against background interference, we propose an ImageNet background interference test set, ImageNet-Bg, based on the ImageNet validation set with 48,285 images. All images in this dataset are generated by removing ID-relevant regions from samples in the ImageNet validation set. We filter the images to obtain the ImageNet-Bg(S) test set, which contains purer background information with 24,863 images.

## Pseudo-OOD Generation

### Image Masking
Please follow these steps:

Step1: Please install [Grounded-Segment-Anything](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything).

Step2: Copy the ./GroundingSAM/masking.py and ./GroundingSAM/classnames.py file into your Grounded-Segment-Anything project directory.

Step3: Run the following command:
```
python masking.py --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py   --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth   --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth   --output_dir "output_dir"   --box_threshold 0.3   --text_threshold 0.25    --device "cuda"
```
Note: Set "output_dir" to your image directory, and place the images to be processed in the "./output_dir/raw" directory.
### Image Inpainting
Please follow these steps:

Step1: Please install [Inpaint-Anything](https://github.com/geekyutao/Inpaint-Anything).

Step2: Copy the ./Inpainting/inpainting.py, ./Inpainting/Texture_inpainting.py and ./GroundingSAM/classnames.py file into your Inpaint-Anything project directory.

Step3: Run the following command to generate the inpainting images:
```
python inpainting.py --output_dir output    --lama_ckpt ./pretrained_models/big-lama  --min=0.0  --max=0.25
```

Step4: Run the following command to compute the score of inpainting images:
```
python get_clip_score.py  --output_dir output
```
Step5: To generate the texture OOD aug data, please run the following command:
```
python Texture_inpainting.py  --output_dir output    --lama_ckpt ./pretrained_models/big-lama  --min=0.0  --max=0.25
```
